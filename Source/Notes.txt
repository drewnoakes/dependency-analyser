TODO:

- compare references as dictated by compiler, versus those specified in projects/solution
- recent files list

- analyser constructors to take filenames

- support vs 8.0 sln files
- remember user's preferences for exclusion

- support merging of multiple solution files
- allow multiple select in Open dialog
- allow printing of the image
- use colouring/shapes on graph
  - indicate assemblies loaded from GAC, and those loaded from root directory
  - colour for those with more/less/no dependancies/dependants
- reintroduce 'extra commands' to DotCommandBuilder
- progress bar
- show number of dependants/dependancies in exclusion list
- menu items to show/hide all System.*
- colour coding for nodes using wildcards (e.g. System.* = blue)

DONE:

- support merging additional .dll/.exe asseblies when started with a .exe or .dll
- fix 'save png' to save to temp file and copy (needed to close FileStream before calling GDI+ save method)
- use template for temp file names, so can clean up behind Wingraphviz (or dispose)
- tidy code for loading of assemblies
- extract class to create DependancyGraph (build graph in a single object instance)
- allow exclusion of selected assembly names, eg 'mscorlib' (maintain exclusion list in DotCommandBuilder)
- populate exclusion list from actual nodes in diagram
- sort exclusion list alphabetically
- set cursor to hourglass while calculating
- use DialogResult==OK instead of handling OK click event for open/save dialogs
